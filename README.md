1. Importing Required Libraries

import numpy as np
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf import HKDF

- numpy: Although imported, it’s not used in the code. Typically used for numerical operations.
- cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec: This module provides Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography functions, specifically key generation and key exchange.
- cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes: Provides hash functions, used to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf: Implements the HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function), used to derive symmetric keys from shared secrets.

2. Key Generation Function

def generate_keys():
    private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP384R1())
    public_key = private_key.public_key()
    return private_key, public_key

- ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP384R1()): Generates a private key using the SECP384R1 elliptic curve, which is a 384-bit prime curve known for its balance between security and performance.
- private_key.public_key(): Derives the corresponding public key from the private key.
- The function returns both the private and public keys.

Mathematical Background:

In elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), key generation involves selecting a random private key d and computing the public key Q using the elliptic curve point multiplication:

    Q = d * G

Where:
- d is the private key (a random integer).
- G is a generator point on the elliptic curve.
- Q is the resulting public key.

3. Key Derivation Using ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)

def derive_shared_secret(private_key, peer_public_key):
    shared_secret = private_key.exchange(ec.ECDH(), peer_public_key)
    derived_key = HKDF(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=None,
        info=b'post-quantum key agreement'
    ).derive(shared_secret)
    return derived_key

- private_key.exchange(ec.ECDH(), peer_public_key): Performs an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to compute a shared secret using the private key and the peer’s public key.
- The shared secret is then processed using the HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) to derive a symmetric key suitable for encryption.

Mathematical Background:

ECDH works by both parties generating their keys and performing the following operation:

    shared_secret_A = private_key_A * public_key_B
    shared_secret_B = private_key_B * public_key_A

Since multiplication in ECC is commutative, both shared secrets are the same.

4. Encrypting a Message

def encrypt_message(message, key):
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
    from os import urandom
    
    iv = urandom(16)
    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CFB(iv))
    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
    ciphertext = encryptor.update(message.encode()) + encryptor.finalize()
    return iv + ciphertext

- urandom(16): Generates a random 16-byte IV (Initialization Vector) for AES encryption.
- Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CFB(iv)): Configures an AES cipher in CFB (Cipher Feedback Mode) using the derived key and IV.
- encryptor.update(message.encode()): Encrypts the message in chunks.
- encryptor.finalize(): Completes the encryption process.
- The function returns the concatenation of the IV and ciphertext.

Mathematical Background:

AES encryption consists of several transformations:
1. SubBytes: Non-linear byte substitution using an S-box.
2. ShiftRows: Row-wise permutation of the state matrix.
3. MixColumns: Mixing operation across columns.
4. AddRoundKey: XOR operation with the round key.

For AES-CFB mode, encryption is computed as:

    C_i = E_k(IV) ⊕ P_i

5. Decrypting a Message

def decrypt_message(encrypted_message, key):
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
    
    iv = encrypted_message[:16]
    ciphertext = encrypted_message[16:]
    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CFB(iv))
    decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
    decrypted_message = decryptor.update(ciphertext) + decryptor.finalize()
    return decrypted_message.decode()

6. Simulating Key Exchange

private_key_A, public_key_A = generate_keys()
private_key_B, public_key_B = generate_keys()

7. Computing Shared Keys

shared_key_A = derive_shared_secret(private_key_A, public_key_B)
shared_key_B = derive_shared_secret(private_key_B, public_key_A)

8. Message Encryption and Decryption

message = "Post-quantum security is essential!"
encrypted_msg = encrypt_message(message, shared_key_A)
decrypted_msg = decrypt_message(encrypted_msg, shared_key_B)

9. Printing Results

print(f"Original message: {message}")
print(f"Decrypted message: {decrypted_msg}")

Quantum Cryptography Overview

Threats Posed by Quantum Computing

Shor’s algorithm poses a significant risk to ECC and RSA encryption by efficiently solving the discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems.

For ECC:

    Q = d * G

A quantum computer can solve for d using Shor’s algorithm in:

    O(log(d))

Post-Quantum Cryptography

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) focuses on algorithms resistant to quantum attacks. Some promising approaches include:
1. Lattice-Based Cryptography:
    - Security based on solving the shortest vector problem (SVP).
    - Example: Learning with Errors (LWE).
2. Code-Based Cryptography:
    - Based on error-correcting codes.
    - Example: McEliece cryptosystem.
3. Hash-Based Cryptography:
    - Security relies on hash function properties.
    - Example: SPHINCS+ (stateless signatures).
4. Multivariate Polynomial Cryptography:
    - Uses multivariate equations over finite fields.
